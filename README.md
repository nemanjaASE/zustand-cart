# 🛒 Simple E-Commerce App

This is a simple e-commerce application built with React. It features a basic shopping cart implemented using [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for state management.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) – Frontend library
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) – Lightweight state management
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) – Fast build and development tool
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – Utility-first CSS framework

## ✅ Features

- Display list of products
- Add items to cart
- Remove items from cart
- View total price
- Manage cart state with Zustand store

## 📦 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nemanjaASE/zustand-cart.git
cd zustand-cart
```
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be running at http://localhost:5173 (or a different port if 5173 is in use).
## 🧠 Notes

This project uses Zustand as a simpler alternative to Redux for local state management. It's ideal for small to medium projects where complex middleware isn't necessary.
